      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was done as a part of my academic curriculum. The flow of project is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)Teacher walks in the classroom and open mobile app. They can signed in by their teacher id.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)Students can signed in the same application by using their student id.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3)Teacher will press a sound emmiting button in their smart phone which will emit sound waves that can be received by students smart phones. Once the sound waves is received then the attendence of student will be marked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology included in the project are: Android studio for designing mobile app, java language for coding, MySQL database for storing student records, and RSA encryption algorithm for maintaining the confidentiality of students.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was a done in Gujarat Industrial hackathon conducted on 12 february 2018. This project was qualified into the final round of hackathon by competing among 500+ teams in hackathon. In this project, we planned to associate RFID tags to every products in the mall. The flow of system is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the customer finished shoping, they will go to the billing counter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be an RFID-based door in billing counter where the customer will pass through and all the items will get scanned automatically using RFID tags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then the overall cost of all items will be displayed and the customer just need to do the payment. Hence, reducing time in manual scanning of items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technologies use to develop this system are: Arduino UNO for making RFID scanner, C language for coding Arduino UNO, RFID chips, and MySQL database for storing customer records.&lt;/p&gt;
